This software is a very simple implementation of a virtual (single stack)
machine.

It was originally written by Sylvain Lombardy at Université Paris-Est
Marne-la-Vallée (UPEM). Afterwards, it has been modified by Nicolas Bedon and
Christophe Morvan. Gaël Fuhs has contributed a nice implementation of a dynamic
array, in order to remove the hard coded 100 label limit. Further, Wuthy Hay has
performed improvements on the entire code base. Recently, Quentin Campos and
Jefferson Mangue have modified the grammar to get rid of the 10000 LOC limit.

Currently this software is maintained by Christophe Morvan.
