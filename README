This software is a very simple implementation of a virtual (single stack) machine.

It was originally written by Sylvain Lombardy at Université Paris-Est
Marne-la-Vallée (UPEM). Afterwards, it has been modified by Nicolas
Bedon and Christophe Morvan. Gaël Fuhs has contributed a nice
implementation of a dynamic array, in order to remove the hard coded
100 label limit. Further, Wuthy Hay has performed improvements on the
entire code base. Recently, Quentin Campos and Jefferson Mangue have
modified the grammar to get rid of the 10000 LOC limit. In 2015,
Céline Noël has further improved several elements of the code, in
particular in the management of the stack.

Currently this software is maintained by Christophe Morvan and Éric Laporte.
